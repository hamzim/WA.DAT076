# DAT076
Project in DAT076

# Building
First off, install:

* npm / yarn
* gulp (npm install -g gulp)
* node (npm install -g node)

Next up, in order to build:

```bash
$> npm install
- this will take a while
$> gulp
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
$> yarn install
- this will go fast
$> gulp
```

Do not worry if you get some error in the beginning, run gulp twice on the first run in order to copy all the files. Angular generates some warnings with webpack by the way.
